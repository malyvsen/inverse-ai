    <h1>Inverse AI</h1>
    <p>Bachelor thesis: transferring neural networks from computers to human brains.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      I turned 256 movie descriptions into pictures with AI.
      The pictures have nothing in common with the movies at first glance, but the AI did follow some rules while creating them - let's see if you can figure it out!
      I myself don't actually know these rules, they were made up by the AI.

      Don't worry if this seems obscure at first, you'll get feedback after every answer - and hopefully will be able to learn.
